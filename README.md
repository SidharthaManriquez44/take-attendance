# 🎒 Take Attendance

A simple tool to help elementary school teachers organize their student lists, take attendance quickly, and assign classroom seating or teams — all in a fun and efficient way!

This project is developed in **Python** and allows the teacher to upload a CSV file and generate student assignments automatically.
